<p>Standing majestically on the Belfast waterfront, Titanic Belfast is the world’s largest Titanic visitor experience and a testament to Belfast’s rich maritime heritage. Built on the exact site where the RMS Titanic was designed, built, and launched, this striking building tells the story of the ship that captured the world’s imagination.</p>

  <li><strong>Awards</strong>: Winner of numerous architectural awards including the Royal Institute of British Architects Award</li>

<p>The Giant’s Causeway stands as one of Northern Ireland’s most spectacular natural attractions, captivating visitors with its otherworldly landscape of hexagonal basalt columns that seem too perfect to be natural. Located on the rugged Antrim Coast, this UNESCO World Heritage Site has been inspiring awe and wonder for centuries.</p>

<h2 id="the-legend-of-finn-mccool">The Legend of Finn McCool</h2>

<p>Irish folklore tells the tale of the giant Finn McCool (Fionn mac Cumhaill), who built the causeway as a bridge to Scotland to fight his rival, the Scottish giant Benandonner. When Finn saw the enormous size of his opponent, he fled back to Ireland, where his clever wife Oonagh disguised him as a baby. Upon seeing the “infant’s” size, Benandonner feared the father must be massive and fled, destroying the causeway behind him. Only the ends remain today - the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland and Fingal’s Cave in Scotland.</p>

<h2 id="the-science-behind-the-wonder">The Science Behind the Wonder</h2>

<p>The reality is equally fascinating. Around 50-60 million years ago, volcanic activity created these remarkable formations. As molten basalt lava cooled and contracted, it formed the distinctive hexagonal columns we see today. The causeway contains approximately 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, with some reaching heights of 12 meters.</p>
