# Titanic Belfast: Where History Comes to Life

<div class="celtic-pattern"></div>

Standing majestically on the Belfast waterfront, Titanic Belfast is the world's largest Titanic visitor experience and a testament to Belfast's rich maritime heritage. Built on the exact site where the RMS Titanic was designed, built, and launched, this striking building tells the story of the ship that captured the world's imagination.

## The Building: An Architectural Marvel

Titanic Belfast's distinctive design, created by CivicArts and Todd Architects, mirrors the ship's dramatic story:

- **Height**: 38 meters tall, matching the height of the Titanic's hull
- **Shape**: Four angular metallic "bow" sections representing the ship's prows
- **Materials**: Reflective aluminum shards create a hull-like appearance
- **Awards**: Winner of numerous architectural awards including the Royal Institute of British Architects Award

The building's facade changes throughout the day, reflecting light like water, creating a dynamic memorial to the ship and the 1,500 people who lost their lives.
